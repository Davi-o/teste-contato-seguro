> Steps to run the application
> > API steps
> - *Clone this repository in `/var/www/html` (the php server web folder)*
> - If you don't have the sqlite3 php driver installed on your machine run `sudo apt install php-sqlite3 -y`
> - Then install the `/api` dependencies with ``composer install``
> - And *less but not least*
>  <br>Make sure your ambient is ready to work with the api routes by enabling `AllowOverride All` on your `httpd.conf`
